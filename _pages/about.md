Hi there! I am a Master's student at Technical University of Munich. My research interests mostly lie in inferring more 
about the physical world - and creating a model of the same - using machine learning architectures. Such a model has several 
applications - it can help answer pertinent questions regarding the causes of any phenomena that occurs in their scope, help 
learn a policy that can output controls to drive the physical environment to a goal state that satisfies desired properties, 
or given a chain of previous observations, help predict what would happen next.
