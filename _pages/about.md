Hi there! I am an AI Resident at Facebook AI Research (FAIR) in Menlo Park, California. I am a part of the Robotics LAB at FAIR and am working currently on exploration and representation learning for control and manipulation of robotic arms from visual data. 

**BackGround**

I completed my Master's from Technical University of Munich. During the time, I was also a Praktikantin at the AI Research team under Prof. Dr. Patrick Van der Smagt at Volkswagen AG. I completed my master's thesis, focusing on the development state-space models for learning dynamics for control at the lab during this period. 

**Interests**

My *academic* interests mostly lie in inferring more about the physical world (and creating a model of the same) using machine 
learning architectures. Such a model has several applications - it can help answer pertinent questions regarding the causes of 
any phenomena that occur in their scope, help learn a policy that can output controls to drive the physical environment to a 
goal state that satisfies desired properties, or given a chain of previous observations, help predict what would happen next.

I am also interested in learning control policies for a dynamic environment that utilize intrinsic motivation techniques. This is 
especially useful when extrinsic rewards are sparse or unavailable for a given task (such as exploration).

Apart from the above, I enjoy doodling, reading mystery novels and have recently found a fondness for writing!
