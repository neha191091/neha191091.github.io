Hi there! I am a Master's student (informatics) at Technical University of Munich. I am also a Praktikantin at the AI Research team at Volkswagen AG. (Munich).

**BackGround**

I completed my Bachelors from Delhi Technological University (New Delhi) in 2013. Following that, I worked for an year at McAfee as a Software Developer in Test, 
where I was involved with the test and development of a whitelisting product for Windows Operating Systems. This was followed 
by two years at Epic Systems, where I worked as a Software Developer for several web based applications.

**Interests**

My research interests mostly lie in inferring more about the physical world - and creating a model of the same - using machine 
learning architectures. Such a model has several applications - it can help answer pertinent questions regarding the causes of 
any phenomena that occur in their scope, help learn a policy that can output controls to drive the physical environment to a 
goal state that satisfies desired properties, or given a chain of previous observations, help predict what would happen next.

I have recently found a fondness for writing. I started with small stuff - like writing about a few of my travel experiences and a few 
(mostly lame) jokes along with my partner. You can check them out here[https://www.grumpychickens.com/]!!
