*Abstract*

Learning a model of dynamics from high-dimensional images can be a core ingredient for success in many applications across different domains, especially in sequential decision making.
However, currently prevailing methods based on latent-variable models are limited to working with low resolution images only. 
In this work, we show that some of the issues with using high-dimensional observations arise from the discrepancy between the dimensionality of the latent and observable space, and propose solutions to overcome them.
