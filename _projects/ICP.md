Iterative closest Point (ICP) is an algorithm employed to minimize the difference between
two point clouds given an initial estimate of the relative pose. It is often used to reconstruct
2D or 3D surfaces from different scans, to localize robots and achieve optimal path
planning and to register medical scans. ICP has several steps and each step may be
implemented in various ways which give rise to a multitude of ICP variants. This project
implements and analyzes several variants of ICP, comparing them on the basis of
execution speed and quality of the result.
